		<h2>Keeping stories incognito</h2>
		<span class="f5 db lh-copy measure-wide">
			Submitted stories will have all identifying non-pertinent information changed to pseudo-names during the editing phase. This applies to, but is not limited to, specific names of people, names of places, names of occupations, ages, or other specific characteristics that can easily identify the geographic location or the person. This will ensure that every story remains incognito and protects the anonymity of those submitting stories.
