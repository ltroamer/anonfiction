					<span class="leader f4"><strong>anonfiction</strong></span> asks readers to write about their own everyday experiences as they pertain to any one of a set of topics.  Topics are intentionally wide-ranging to allow room for creativity and expression.

				<p class="f4 lh-copy measure-wide">
					All stories are accepted, as long as they are nonfiction. The style of writing is not as important as being genuine and thoughtful. There is no word limit.

					You may <a href="/write">submit stories online</a>, or email them as an attachment to <a href="mailto:stories@anonfiction.comSubject=Story%20Submission" target="_top">stories@anonfiction.com</a>. In order to ensure privacy of the writer, stories will be edited to remove identifying
					names, places, or occupations. Unless crucial to the story, such instances will be changed to
					pseudo-names.
